# Go-movies-CRUD
This project is a simple RESTful API built using Go, which allows you to manage a collection of movies. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for handling movie data. The API is powered by the Gorilla Mux router and uses JSON to communicate data between the client and the server. Each movie in the collection has an ID, ISBN, title, and an associated director with a first and last name. The endpoints include functionalities to list all movies, retrieve a single movie by ID, add a new movie, update an existing movie, and delete a movie by ID. The server runs on port 8000, making it easy to interact with using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This project demonstrates the core concepts of building RESTful services in Go, making it an ideal starting point for more complex API development.
